## About Ice Cream Cream App Project

The Ice Cream Cream App project is designed to provide hands-on practice in building a simple web application using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript(making it a react app). By working on this project, you will gain experience in creating user interfaces, manipulating the Document Object Model (DOM), export and import in React and handling user interactions.

The main objective of this project is to create a counter that keeps track of the number of people entering an ice cream shop. It provides a basic user interface where users can increment or decrement the counter to reflect the number of people entering or leaving the shop.

## Project Features

The Ice Cream Cream App project includes the following features:
- **Increment and Decrement**: Users can increment or decrement the counter to add or remove people from the count.
- **Save button**: The counter has a button that saves in real-time as users interact with the increment and decrement buttons.

These features provide a straightforward and intuitive way to keep track of the number of people entering the ice cream shop.
